This is the read me file for our group project. Our collaborators are Samaira, Clarissa and Maksim! 
Our project is an Events Management platform dedicated to Modulians to have an easy access to events such as university events, external events, club events, and MCC events. The platform is also designed to help the Student Service Centre to better manage the events on one commone space. The SSC would also have the ability to add or remove events as well as approve or decline requested events by Modulians through the platform. 

The platform includes the following:
- Homepage: Shows the main calendar with all the events **(public & private)**
- Admin page: Has the same features as the homepage with the ability to remove or add events **(private)**
- Events Detail Page: Shows more information of the events displayed on the calendar when clicked **(public & private)**
- Request event page: Includes a form to be filled by Modulians who would like to add an event which is submitted to the SSC **(public)**
- Feedback information page: Includes pending event request and the contact information of the SSC **(private)**
- Dashboard page: Dedicated to Modulians and allows them to favourite an evente they're interested in **(private)**
 
Thank you for reading.
